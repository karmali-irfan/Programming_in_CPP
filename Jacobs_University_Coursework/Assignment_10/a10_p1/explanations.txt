Commenting out "using namespace std" is similar to not including a library. The function
or function definition is not present in your code hence the reason for the errors. This
could be fixed by adding "std::" everytime you call string functions, including cin and cout. 

Commenting out "Critter ::" The variable name that you are trying to edit is only present in Critter class. 
Hence the compiler doesn't recognize it since the path to the variable type in absent. "Critter::" specifies
the name of the class it belongs to hence also allowing you to modify that particular variable. To fix this you 
could make the variable "name" under class critter public so that you can easily modify the "name" in the main 
function using "c.name = name" without needing to call a function.
